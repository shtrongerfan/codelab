																<div class="sub_title">Get Started With Rummy Rules</div>
																<div>Rummy is a card game that is played with two decks of cards with total of two Jokers. To win the
																	rummy game a player must make a valid declaration by picking and discarding cards from the two piles
																	given. One pile is a closed deck, where a player is unable to see the card that he is picking, while
																	the other is an open deck that is formed by the cards discarded by the players. To win at rummy card
																	game, the players have to group cards in valid sequences and sets.</div>
																<div>In rummy, the cards in each suit rank low to high starting with Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
																	Jack, Queen and King. Ace, Jack, Queen and King each has 10 points. The remaining cards have value
																	equal to their face value. For example, 5 cards will have 5 points and so on.</div>
																<div class="sub_title">The Objective Of Rummy</div>
																<div>The objective of rummy card game is to arrange the 13 cards in valid sets and sequences. To win
																	the game you need to make minimum 2 sequences, out of which one needs to be pure sequence and rest can
																	be any valid sequence or sets. Without a pure sequence you cannot make a valid rummy declaration. This
																	is one of the most important rummy rules.</div>
																<div class="sub_title">How to Form Sequences?</div>
																<div>In rummy, a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. There are two
																	types of sequences that are formed; a pure sequence and an impure sequence. To win the game of rummy
																	you need at least one pure sequence in your rummy hand.</div>
																<br />
																<div class="sub_title">Pure Sequence</div>
																<div>A pure sequence is a group of three or more cards of the same suit, placed in consecutive order.
																	To form a pure sequence in rummy card game, a player cannot use any Joker or wild card.</div>
																<br />
																<div>Here are a few examples of pure sequence.</div>
																<br />
																<div>1.5<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 6<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 7<span class="red_txt">♥</span>
																	(Pure sequence with three cards and there is no Joker or wild card used)</div>
																<div>2.3<span class="black_txt">♥</span> 4<span class="black_txt">♥</span> 5<span class="black_txt">♥</span>
																	6<span class="black_txt">♥</span> (Pure sequence with four cards. There is no use of Joker or wild
																	cards here.)</div>
																<br />
																<h4>Impure Sequence</h4>
																<div>An impure sequence is a group of three or more cards of the same suit with one or more Joker card
																	used.</div>
																<br />
																<div>Here are some examples to show how an impure sequence is formed.</div>
																<br />
																<div>1.6<span class="red_txt">♦</span> 7<span class="red_txt">♦</span> Q<span class="black_txt">♠</span>
																	9<span class="red_txt">♦</span> (Here Q<span class="red_txt">♠</span> has been used as a wild Joker
																	replacing 8<span class="red_txt">♦</span> to form an impure sequence.)</div>
																<div>2.5<span class="black_txt">♠</span> Q<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 7<span class="black_txt">♠</span>
																	8<span class="black_txt">♠</span> PJ (Impure sequence with Q<span class="red_txt">♥</span> as wild
																	joker that is replacing 6<span class="black_txt">♠</span> and the Printed Joker is replacing 9<span
																	 class="black_txt">♠</span>.)</div>
																<br />
																<div class="sub_title">How to Form Sets?</div>
																<div>A set is a group of three or more cards of the same value but of different suits. When you are
																	forming sets, you can use wild card and Jokers.</div>
																<br />
																<em><strong>Examples of sets</strong></em>
																<div>1.A<span class="red_txt">♥</span> A<span class="black_txt">♣</span> A<span class="red_txt">♦</span>
																	(In this set, all the Ace are of different suits, make a valid set.)</div>
																<div>2.8<span class="red_txt">♦</span> 8<span class="black_txt">♣</span> 8<span class="black_txt">♠</span>
																	8<span class="red_txt">♥</span> (Rummy set is formed with four 8 cards of different suits.)</div>
																<div>3.9<span class="red_txt">♦</span> Q<span class="black_txt">♠</span> 9<span class="black_txt">♠</span>
																	9<span class="red_txt">♥</span> (Here Q<span class="red_txt">♠</span> has been used as wild joker
																	replacing 9<span class="black_txt">♣</span> to make set.)</div>
																<div>4.5<span class="red_txt">♦</span> 5<span class="black_txt">♣</span> 5<span class="black_txt">♠</span>
																	PJ (Printed joker replacing 5<span class="red_txt">♥</span> to make set.)</div>
																<div>5.5<span class="red_txt">♦</span> 5<span class="black_txt">♣</span> Q<span class="black_txt">♠</span>
																	PJ (Here Q♠ has been used as wild joker replacing 5<span class="black_txt">♠</span> & Printed joker
																	replacing 5<span class="black_txt">♥</span> to make set.)</div>
																<div>6.5<span class="red_txt">♦</span> 5<span class="black_txt">♣</span> PJ Q<span class="red_txt">♥</span>
																	Q<span class="red_txt">♠</span> (This is a set of 5 cards with Printed joker & Q<span class="red_txt">♥</span>
																	as wild joker replacing 5<span class="black_txt">♠</span> 5<span class="red_txt">♥</span> and one more
																	wild joker Q<span class="black_txt">♠</span> to complete 13 cards grouping.)</div>
																<div>Typical Example: 2<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 3<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 4<span class="red_txt">♥</span>
																	5<span class="red_txt">♥</span>| 5<span class="black_txt">♣</span> 6<span class="black_txt">♣</span> 7<span
																	 class="black_txt">♣</span> 8<span class="black_txt">♣</span> | 5<span class="red_txt">♦</span> 5<span
																	 class="black_txt">♣</span> PJ Q<span class="black_txt">♥</span> Q<span class="red_txt">♠</span> (Set
																	of 5 cards is made to complete the grouping of 13 cards and make a valid declaration)</div>
																<div class="tips">
																	<strong>Note:</strong> The set is formed with same card of different suits. However, you can’t use two
																	or more cards of the same suit. This is taken as an invalid declaration. Also, note that a set can
																	have more than four cards. So, if you have a set of four cards and you are using an additional Joker,
																	then in total it becomes a 5 cards group and still be a valid set. At no given time, the hand can have
																	more than 13 cards.
																	<em><strong>Examples of invalid set</strong></em>
																	<ol>
																		<li>Q<span class="red_txt">♥</span> Q<span class="red_txt">♥</span> Q<span class="red_txt">♦</span>
																			(There are two Qs of the same suit <span class="red_txt">♥</span> making it an invalid set.)</li>
																		<li>7<span class="black_txt">♠</span> 7<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 7<span class="red_txt">♦</span>
																			7<span class="black_txt">♠</span> Q<span class="red_txt">♥</span> (It has two 7 spades of the same
																			suit. The wild card Q<span class="red_txt">♥</span> as the fifth card is valid but having two 7<span
																			 class="black_txt">♠</span> is making it invalid.)</li>

																<div class="sub_title">How To Play Rummy Card Game?</div>
																<br />
																<div>Follow this simple rummy rules and instructions to know How To Play the game from start to end:</div>
																<br />
																<div>1.Rummy card game is played between 2 to 6 players with 2 decks of cards. Each player is dealt
																	with 13 cards and a random card is selected as wild joker or joker card of the game.</div>
																<div>2.The player has to draw and discard cards to form valid sets and sequences of the 13 cards in
																	hand where player can also use wild joker or printed joker of the deck to make impure sequence and
																	sets.</div>
																<div>3.As per indian rummy rules, once a player arranged 13 cards in valid 2 sequences including 1 pure
																	sequence and more groups (sequences or sets), one can make a declaration and win the game.</div>
																<br />
																<div class="sub_title">Quick Tips To Win The Rummy Card Game</div>
																<div>Just as it’s important to know the rummy rules, it is also necessary to play carefully and with
																	focus. Here are quick tips to win the rummy game and stay a step ahead of your competitors.</div>
																<br>
																<div>
																	<li>
																		Form the pure sequence at the very beginning of the game. Without a pure sequence, a player cannot
																		make a declaration.
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		Discard cards with high points like Ace, Jack, Queen and King. Replace these cards with Joker or Wild
																		Cards. It reduces the point load, in case you lose the game.
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		As much as possible, avoid picking from the discard pile. It gives away what hand you are trying to
																		form.
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		Look out for smart cards. For example, a 7 of any suit can work with 5 and 6 of the same suit and
																		also 8 and 9 of the same suit.
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		Jokers play an important role in rummy. Try using them to replace high value cards. Remember, Joker
																		and wild cards cannot be used to form pure sequence.
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		When you are ready to make a declaration, check and recheck your cards and then press the button. An
																		invalid declaration can turn even a winning game into a complete loss.
																	</li>
																</div>
																<br />
																<div class="sub_title">Common Terms Used In Rummy Rules</div>
																Here are some common terms of Indian Rummy that every player needs to know before he starts playing.
																<br />
																<div class="sub_title">What is a Rummy Table?</div>
																It is the table where the game of rummy is played. Every rummy table can sit two to six players for
																each game.
																<br />
																<div class="sub_title">What is Joker and Wild Cards?</div>
																In each rummy deck there is a Printed Joker and there is a Wild Card that is selected at random at the
																beginning of the game. The role of both these types of card is the same. Jokers are used to form sets
																and impure sequences. A Joker card can replace the desired number when forming the groups. This is a
																valid formation in a rummy game.
																<br />
																<div class="sub_title">What is Draw and Discard?</div>
																In all Rummy games, each player is dealt 13 cards. Additionally, there are 2 stacks from which each
																player can select cards, thereby drawing a card. Once a player draws a card, he has to get rid of one
																card - this is called discarding.
																<br />
																<div class="sub_title">What is Sorting of Cards?</div>
																Sorting of cards are done at the beginning of the game. This is done to arrange your cards to help you
																form your sets and sequences reducing the probability of mixing the cards. Once, the cards are
																displayed, you can hit the Sort button and start playing.
																<br />
																<div class="sub_title">What is a Drop?</div>
																When a player decides to leave the game table at the start or middle of the rummy game, it is a drop.
																The act is withdrawing from the game as a personal decision. The first drop=20 points; middle drop= 40
																points and last drop and maximum point loss is 80 points.
																In case of Pool rummy, if a player drops in 101 pool, the score is 20. In case, it is 201 pool rummy,
																the drop score is 25. In a game, where it is best of 2 and best of 3 is played, then a drop is not
																allowed.
																<br />
																<div class="sub_title">What is an Invalid Declaration?</div>
																An invalid declaration happens in rummy card game when the player presses the Declaration button, but
																the cards are not in valid sequences and sets. Therefore, the player will lose the game and the
																competitor will automatically be declared as the winner.
																Here are few examples of common invalid declarations players make while playing rummy:

																<ul class="list-style-alpa">
																	<li>
																		<div class="sub_title">Wrong Declaration with Invalid Sets</div>
																		Example 1: 10<span class="black_txt">♠</span> 10<span class="black_txt">♠</span> 10<span class="red_txt">♦</span>
																		10<span class="black_txt">♣</span> Q<span class="red_txt">♥</span>
																		<br />
																		A set can have 3 cards or more, however a set needs to be formed with cards of the same value and
																		different suits. In this situation, the Wild Joker (Queen of Hearts) card was added and that became
																		the fifth card, which is valid as per rules, however the group consist of 2 cards of the same suit
																		making it a wrong declaration.
																		<br />
																		Example 2: K<span class="red_txt">♥</span> K<span class="red_txt">♥</span> K<span class="red_txt">♦</span>
																		<br />
																		In this set, there are 3 cards which is well within the minimum limit. Also, a set consists of cards
																		of the same face value but has to be of different suits. The set cannot have more than one card of
																		the same suit. In this example, the set consists of two cards of the same suit and that makes it a
																		wrong declaration.
																	</li>
																	<li>
																		<div class="sub_title">Wrong Declaration with Invalid Sequences</div>
																		Example 1: 10<span class="black_txt">♠</span> 10<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 10<span class="red_txt">♦</span>
																		10<span class="black_txt">♣</span> | 5<span class="black_txt">♠</span> 5<span class="red_txt">♥</span>
																		5<span class="red_txt">♦</span> | 6<span class="black_txt">♠</span> 6<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 6<span
																		 class="black_txt">♣</span> | 9<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 9<span class="red_txt">♦</span> Joker
																		<br />
																		A valid declaration requires 2 sequences, out of which one needs to be pure sequence i.e. sequence
																		without joker and the other can be pure or impure sequence i.e. sequence with or without joker.
																		However, in the given example there is neither sequence made making it an invalid declaration.
																		<br />
																		Example 2: K<span class="red_txt">♥</span> K<span class="black_txt">♠</span> K<span class="red_txt">♦</span>
																		| 6<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 7<span class="red_txt">♥</span> Joker | 9<span class="black_txt">♠</span>
																		10<span class="black_txt">♠</span> J<span class="black_txt">♠</span> Joker | 5<span class="black_txt">♠</span>
																		5<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 5<span class="red_txt">♦</span>
																		<br />
																		A valid declaration must have 2 sequences, out of which one needs to be pure sequence i.e. sequence
																		without joker and the other can be pure or impure sequence i.e. sequence with or without joker. This
																		example shows that there are 2 sequences, but both are impure sequence i.e. sequence with joker and
																		the pure sequence is not there. It is compulsory to have a pure sequence before you make a
																		declaration.
																		<br />
																		Example 3: Q<span class="red_txt">♥</span> Q<span class="black_txt">♠</span> Q<span class="red_txt">♦</span>
																		| 6<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 7<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 8<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 9<span
																		 class="red_txt">♥</span> | 5<span class="black_txt">♠</span> 5<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 5<span
																		 class="red_txt">♦</span> | 10<span class="black_txt">♠</span> 10<span class="red_txt">♥</span> 10<span
																		 class="red_txt">♦</span>
																		<br />
																		Sequences are very important for a rummy card game and you need minimum 2 sequences, out of which one
																		needs to be pure sequence and the other can be pure or impure sequence to win the game. In this
																		example, there is a pure sequence, however the 2nd sequence is missing and hence it is an invalid
																		declaration.
																	</li>
																</ul>

																<div class="sub_title">Combination Possible as per the Above Rules to Declare 13 Cards in Rummy:</div>
																<ol>
																	<li>There is one Pure Sequence of 4 cards</li>
																	<li>There is Impure Sequence of 3 cards where 8<span class="black_txt">♣</span> is a wild joker</li>
																	<li>There is a “Set 1” of 3 cards</li>
																	<li>There is a “Set 2” of 3 cards having a “Printed Joker”</li>
