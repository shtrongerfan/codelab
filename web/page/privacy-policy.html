														<div class="sub_title">6. Disclosures Of Your Personal information</div>
														<div>From time to time, we may need to share your personal information with others, including in the
															following circumstances.</br>
															<strong>Disclosures to the Public.</strong>Some of your personal information will be shared with the
															general public, including your first name and last name initial, city, state, and country. When
															information is made publicly available it may be accessed by anyone with access to the platform to which
															the information is posted. It may also be indexed by third-party search engines, and be imported,
															exported, distributed, aggregated, and redistributed by others without our knowledge.</br>
															<strong>Third Party Service Providers. </strong>We may share your personal information with third party
															service providers who perform various functions to enable us to provide our services and help us operate
															our business, such as website design, sending email communications, fraud detection and prevention,
															customer care, payment processing, or performing analytics. Our contracts with these third parties
															require them to maintain the confidentiality of the personal information we provide to them, only act on
															our behalf and under our instructions, and not use personal information for purposes other than the
															product or service they’re providing to us or on our behalf.</br>
															<strong>With our Affiliates and Partners.</strong>When participating in events or activities that we
															offer along with our partners and/or affiliates, you may be asked to share personal information with
															those affiliates and/or partners. For example, a game, contest, competition, contest, sweepstake or
															other offering may be co-sponsored by another company or companies. In such a situation, the information
															we obtain from you in connection with such contest, sweepstake or offering may be shared with our
															co-sponsor, unless you instruct us not to (which may result in you not being able to participate). In
															some of those cases, we may act as co-controllers of your personal information, depending on the
															circumstances.</br>
															<strong>With Unaffiliated Controllers.</strong>In some cases we may transfer personal information to
															unaffiliated third-party data controllers. These third parties do not act as agents or service providers
															and are not performing functions on our behalf. We may transfer your personal information to third-party
															data controllers for the following purposes: 1) to provide you with third-party offers; 2) to provide us
															information about the quality of our services offerings. We will only provide your personal information
															to third-party data controllers where you have not opted-out of such disclosures, or in the case of
															sensitive personal information, where you have opted-in if the disclosure requires consent. We enter
															into written contracts with any unaffiliated third-party data controllers requiring them to provide the
															same level of protection for your personal information that is required of us. We also limit their use
															of your personal information so that it is consistent with any consent you have provided and with the
															notices you have received.</br>
															<strong>Protection of Lucky Today and Others. </strong>We may share personal information when we believe
															it is appropriate to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights,
															property, or safety of Lucky Today, our products and services, our users, or others. This includes
															exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and risk reduction.
															This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personal information of our
															customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.</br>
															<strong>Response to Subpoenas and Other Legal Requests. </strong>We may share your information with
															courts, law enforcement agencies, or other government bodies when we have a good faith belief we’re
															required or permitted to do so by law, including to meet national security or law enforcement
															requirements, to protect our company, or to respond to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or other
															law enforcement request.</br>
															<strong>Sale of Our Business.</strong>If we sell, merge, or transfer any part of our business, we may be
															required to share your information. If so, you will be asked if you’d like to stop receiving promotional
															information following any change of control.</br>
															With your Consent. Other than as set out above, we will provide you with notice and the opportunity to
															choose when your personal information may be shared with other third parties.</br>
														</div></br>

														<div class="sub_title">7. Data Security</div>
														<div>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being
															accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit
															access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who
															have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and
															they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any
															suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where
															we are legally required to do so.</div></br>
														<div class="sub_title">8. Data Retention</div>
														<div>We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we
															collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
															requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the
															amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from
															unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your
															personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable
															legal requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data (see “EU Data Subjects
															Legal Rights”). In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no
															longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this
															information indefinitely without further notice to you.</div></br>

														<div>9. International Data Transfers</div>
														<div>Lucky Today has its headquarters in the United States. Information we collect from you will be
															processed in the United States. Where we transfer EU data subject’s personal information to third
															parties outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we rely on appropriate suitable safeguards or
															specific derogations recognized under data protections law, including the GDPR. The European Commission
															has adopted standard data protection clauses, which provide safeguards for Personal information
															transferred outside of the EEA. We may use Standard Contractual Clauses when transferring Personal
															information from a country in the EEA to a country outside the EEA.</div></br>
														<div class="sub_title">10. EU Data Subjects Privacy Rights</div>
														<div>EU data subjects have certain rights with respect to your personal information that we collect and
															process. We respond to all requests we receive from individuals in the EEA wishing to exercise their
															data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</div></br>
														<ul>
															<li>•<strong>Access, Correction or Deletion.</strong>You may request access to, correction of, or
																deletion of your personal information. You can often go directly into the Service under Account
																Settings to take these actions. Please note that even if you request for your personal information to
																be deleted, certain aspects may be retained for us to: meet our legal or regulatory compliance (e.g.
																maintaining records of transactions you have made with us); exercise, establish or defend legal claims;
																and to protect against fraudulent or abusive activity on our Service. Data retained for these purposes
																will be handled as described in Section 9 “Data Retention”,above.</li>
															<li>•<strong>Objection.</strong>You may object to processing of your personal information where we are
																relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your
																particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts
																on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your
																personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
																compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
															<li>•<strong>Restriction.</strong>You have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your
																personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;
																(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to
																hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal
																claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have
																overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
															<li>•<strong>Portability.</strong>You have the right to request the transfer of your personal
																information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your
																personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only
																applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used
																the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
															<li>•<strong>Withdraw Consent.</strong>If we have collected and processed your personal information with
																your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time.Withdrawing your consent will not affect the
																lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of
																your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
															<li>•<strong>File a complaint.</strong>You have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory
																authority about our collection and processing of your personal information.</li>
														</ul></br>
														<div>To file a request or take action on one of your rights, please contact us at the contact details
															provided. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the
															other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive
